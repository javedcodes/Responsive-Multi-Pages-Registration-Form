# Responsive Multi-Page Registration Form

Perhaps the most vital aspect of website design involving registration forms is that the form should preferably be multipaged and responsive. The large form is broken down into sub-forms, in order to reduce the number of fields to be filled in on a single page.

Here in this article, I am going to present a free **<a href="https://jvcodes.com/responsive-multi-pages-registration-form/">Responsive Multi-Page Registration Form</a>** source code that can be implemented using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript and can be customized by the users.

This form is responsive, which means that the form is flexible and can fit perfectly on any device ranging from desktops, tablets, and mobiles.
